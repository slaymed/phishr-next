## How does it work ?

The API takes a string URL as input and returns a probability value (0-100) of URL being malicious. We declare a URL malicious if it crosses a probability value of 70%. To determine if a URL is malicious or legitimate we use a Neural Network trained on 600,000 URLs. To see how exactly the model works,checkout the model training repository [here](https://github.com/deepeshdm/Phishing-Attack-Domain-Detection).
