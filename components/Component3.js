                Phishing assaults are becoming more common as the number of web users grows. To properly respond to
                various phishing assualts, through thorough understanding of phishing attacks is required , as are
                suitable response tactics. Furthermore, the growing number of phishing websites has made individuals and
                businesses all over the world more vulnerable to numerous assualts. As a result, stronger cyber defence
                necessitates more efficient phishing detection...

            <p className="hdw-para">
                A phishing detection rate of 99.78% with an accuracy score of 0.998. This project's algorithms
                outperform the current state of the art in deep learning-based phishing website identification. Our
                various approaches proved their validity by delivering accuracy of (99.72%), (99.74%), and (99.78%),
                respectively, making them far more successful at detecting phishing websites. Furthermore, utilizing
                only 18 characteristics based on the length-based features, count-based features, and binary features of
                URLs, our technique produced an accuracy of greater than 99.70%.Furthermore, the best machine learning
                algorithm was preserved and may be utilized in online browsers, search engines, social networking
                platforms, and so on, or by the user directly to detect phishing website domains.
